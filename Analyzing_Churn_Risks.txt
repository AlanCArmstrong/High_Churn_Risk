Research Question:
Out of the categories with the highest observed churn rates, what are those customers' biggest concerns according to the surveys?



Columns from Customers:

Columns from Survey_Responses:
Customer_id                - Varchar(10), Primary Key
Timely_Reponse             - Varchar(1)
Timely_Fixes               - Varchar(1)
Timely_Replacements        - Varchar(1)

Creating survey responses table:

CREATE TABLE public."Survey_responses"
(
    "Customer_id" character varying NOT NULL,
    "Timely_Reponse" character varying NOT NULL,
    "Timely_Fixes " character varying NOT NULL,
    "Timely_Replacements" character varying NOT NULL,
    "Reliability" character varying NOT NULL,
    "Options " character varying NOT NULL,
    "Respectful_Response" character varying NOT NULL,
    "Courteous_Exchange" character varying NOT NULL,
    "Evidence_of_Act_Listening" character varying NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY ("Customer_id")
);

ALTER TABLE public.customer
    ADD FOREIGN KEY ("Customer_id")
    REFERENCES public."Survey_responses" ("Customer_id")
    NOT VALID;

END;



Finding base churn rate:

select cast(count(customer_id) as float)/(select cast(count(customer_id) as float) from customer) as base_churn_rate
from customer
where churn = 'Yes'

base_churn_rate = 0.265



Taking samples to find 'high'(99.9th percentile) churn rate to compare potential outliers with:

select (select cast(count(customer_id) as float) as churn_rate
from (select * from customer order by random() limit 100) as A
where churn = 'Yes')/100 as rand

take 100 samples and standard deviation and mean is:
.0426 and .265 (there are 2650/1000 churners)

3.29 * .0426 + .265 = .405



Finding all potential outliers for churn rate for categorical data:

select (select cast(count(customer_id) as float) from customer where churn = 'Yes' and techie = 'Yes')/(select count(customer_id) from customer where techie = 'Yes' ) as base_churn_rate
from customer
limit 1

the rest are the same except ctrl+h category name

0.33055390113162597 = techie_yes
0.2517726234827545 = techie_no
0.2687215556474969 = port_modem_yes
0.26151761517615174 = port_modem_no
0.26312270143764627 = tablet_yes
0.2658011128549008 = tablet_no
...



Code to find churn rate for continuous data:

select (select cast(count(customer_id) as float) from customer where churn = 'Yes' and yearly_equip_faiure > 3)/(select count(customer_id) from customer where yearly_equip_faiure > 3) as yearly_equip_failure_churn_rate
from customer
limit 1

examples higher than .405:

45.7% = bandwidth_gp_year < 4000
44.6% = monthly_charge > 180
50.6% = tenure < 12

All three conditions simultaneously: 78.6% (1437 people) vs a base rate of 26.5%
This is the consumer group that the company should focus on retaining.



Code to check their survey response data:

select sum(cast(s.timely_responses as int))
from (select customer_id from customer where bandwidth_gp_year < 4000 and monthly_charge > 180 and tenure < 12) c inner join survey_responses s on c.customer_id = s.customer_id

Timely_Reponse = 5067/1437                =3.53
Timely_Fixes = 5092/1437                  =3.5
Timely_Replacements = 5057/1437           =3.52
Reliability = 5045/1437                   =3.51
Options = 5023/1437                       =3.49
Respectful_Response = 5110/1437           =3.56
Courteous_Exchange = 5058/1437            =3.52
Evidence_of_Active_Listening = 5022/1437  =3.49

Comparing with customers in the opposite group (2983 people, churn rate .0058%)
(bandwidth > 4000, monthly_charge < 180, tenure > 12):

Timely_Reponse = 10003/2983               =3.35
Timely_Fixes = 10044/2983                 =3.37
Timely_Replacements = 9963/2983           =3.34
Reliability = 10163/2983                  =3.41
Options = 10098/2983                      =3.39
Respectful_Response = 10026/2983          =3.36
Courteous_Exchange = 10189/2983           =3.42
Evidence_of_Active_Listening = 10080/2983 =3.38

Comparing with all 10000 customers:

Timely_Reponse                            =3.39
Timely_Fixes                              =3.51
Timely_Replacements                       =3.49
Reliability                               =3.5
Options                                   =3.49
Respectful_Response                       =3.5
Courteous_Exchange                        =3.51
Evidence_of_Active_Listening              =3.5

There is not enough support for any particular category that is deemed as more
important, according to the focal consumer group.



Checking which time frames are most relevant to churn concerns:

select (select cast(count(customer_id) as float) from customer where churn = 'Yes' and tenure < 2)/(select count(customer_id) from customer where tenure < 2) as yearly_equip_failure_churn_rate
from customer
limit 1

When tenure is < 2, churn rate is 62%.

select (select cast(count(customer_id) as float) from customer where churn = 'Yes' and tenure > 28 and tenure < 34)/(select count(customer_id) from customer where tenure > 28 and tenure < 34) as yearly_equip_failure_churn_rate
from customer
limit 1

Churn does not return to average levels until 28 months

select count(customer_id)
from customer
where tenure < 28

4960, or about half of customers are below this threshold.
Data should be updated as soon as it is obtained as to keep updated on these customers.
