# Predictors of Churn

In this project, I used SQL to find the consumer groups with the highest churn rates.
The annotated code and the conclusions are shown in the following link:

I also visualized the main findings using Python's MatPlotLib.Pyplot, including the elevated churn rates of substantial portions of the database:

As well as the heightened churn rates at the beginning of customers' tenure and the slow drop off below the average rate:
