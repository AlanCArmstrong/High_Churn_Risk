# High_Churn_Risk

In this project, I used SQL to find the consumer groups with the highest churn rates.
The annotated code and the conclusions are shown in the following link:  
([https://github.com/AlanCArmstrong/High_Churn_Risk/blob/main/Analyzing_Churn_Risks.txt])

I also visualized the main findings using Python's MatPlotLib.Pyplot, including the elevated churn rates of substantial portions of the database (in this case, about 15%):

As well as the heightened churn rates at the beginning of customers' tenure and the slow drop off below the average rate:
